# Cook Island
A game created during the Global game jam in 2018. 
In addition to the theme Transmission, we chosen a theme about Irritatable Bowel Syndrom therapie.

## GamePlay
When you started the program, you can tilt your iOS and Android device to aim at the direction you wish to go. The character will walk into that direction for five seconds.
However the screen will turn black during that time and the Accelerometer(Android) and Gyroscope(iOS) will still function.
